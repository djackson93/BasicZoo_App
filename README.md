# BasicZoo_App
This is the barebones code used for the project of making an app that let you cycle through images of animals at a zoo. It included 3 screen: Title Screen (that would open and then progress to main screen after 5 seconds), Main Screen, and a Settings screen. The app was to allow you to click on the animal's images and the appropriate animal noise was to play.
